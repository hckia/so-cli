# so-cli

SO-cli is a flat file application that parses backups generated by Stack Overflow teams. It was created in a temporary lapse of sanity, and once enough time was invested I decided to keep improving it wherever time allowed.

## Okay... What does it do?

Basically allows you to search your teams' backups from a command line interface, and write the results to a txt, html, or markdown file. Down the road it will provide more features.

## What works right now?

You can do a Generic search, or Search By date right now and have the results in txt,html, or md format.

## Features Coming soon
1. Improved Generic Search Algoritihm (ignore prefixes, adverbs, etc.)
2. test search parameters
3. help flag
4. installation script
5. Ability to Search by Title, or ID. SearchbyPostType will just list the amount of answers or Questions provided.
6. Ability to search for any Questions/Answers the past 7 days (just counting)
7. Since markdown in StackOverflow is annoying, i'll probably add a formt checker that will make sure the syntax of an md file provided isn't going to have any issues.
8. export to a NoSQL database (probably mongodb)
9. export all to a directory in format of choosing.
